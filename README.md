# Data-Driven Control
The design of the controller are based entirely on experimental data collected from the plant

## PID controller
PID contoller
A proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller or three-term controller)
is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used inindustrial control systems
and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.::
